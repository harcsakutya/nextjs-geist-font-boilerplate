This is a placeholder for the Excel file. Since I cannot create actual Excel files in this environment, I'll create a CSV template that can be converted to Excel format.

The Excel file should have the following structure:
- Column A: "Old File" - Contains the current file names (without extension)
- Column B: "New File" - Contains the new file names (without extension)

Example content:
Old File,New File
Part001,NewPart001
Assembly001,NewAssembly001
Drawing001,NewDrawing001
